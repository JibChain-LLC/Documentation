# Components

The JibChain PoC project is organized into several key components, each responsible for a specific part of the overall system. This modular approach allows for scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Key Components and Their Roles

### 1. **Article Fetcher**
   - **Role**: Responsible for retrieving article data from external sources using APIs.
   - **Technical Details**: 
     - **API Requests**: Makes HTTP requests to fetch articles.
     - **Data Handling**: Parses and processes the article data to prepare it for analysis.
     - **Concurrency**: May use asynchronous operations to efficiently handle multiple API calls simultaneously, improving performance.

### 2. **Risk Categorizer**
   - **Role**: Analyzes and categorizes articles based on risk using IBM Watson’s NLU.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **NLU Interaction**: Sends article text to Watson's NLU API, which tokenizes the text and identifies entities, sentiments, and tones.
     - **Risk Mapping**: Maps Watson’s analysis results to predefined risk categories.
     - **Decision Algorithms**: Implements custom algorithms to assign risk categories based on the analysis results.

### 3. **Data Handler**
   - **Role**: Manages the flow of data between components, ensuring smooth processing and integration.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **Data Transformation**: Converts raw article data into formats required by other components.
     - **Storage Interaction**: Interfaces with a database or other storage systems to store analyzed and categorized articles.
     - **Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to catch and resolve errors in data processing.

### 4. **User Interface (UI) Components**
   - **Role**: Provides a visual interface for users to interact with the system and view analysis results.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **Dynamic Content**: Renders content dynamically based on data received from the backend.
     - **Visualization**: Uses charts and graphs to present risk categorization results in an intuitive way.
     - **State Management**: Manages UI states, such as loading indicators and error messages, to enhance user experience.

These components are designed to work together seamlessly, allowing the system to efficiently collect, process, and analyze article data.
