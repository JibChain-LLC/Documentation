# Services

The services in the JibChain PoC project are the backbone of the system, handling the core logic that enables article retrieval, analysis, and risk categorization. 

## Detailed Explanation of Services

### 1. **Article API Service**
   - **Purpose**: Fetches article data from external APIs and prepares it for analysis.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **API Integration**: Utilizes RESTful APIs to retrieve articles, handling authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.
     - **Data Normalization**: Ensures that article data from various sources is normalized into a consistent format for uniform processing.

### 2. **Watson Risk Categorization Service**
   - **Purpose**: Interfaces with IBM Watson's NLU to analyze and categorize articles based on risk.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **NLU Configuration**: Configures the Watson NLU service to focus on specific features such as entity recognition and sentiment analysis, tailored to the project's needs.
     - **Result Processing**: Processes Watsonâ€™s analysis results, mapping them to specific risk categories using custom algorithms.
     - **Optimization**: Optimized for performance, handling large volumes of articles by batching requests and using parallel processing.

### 3. **Data Processing Service**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the flow and transformation of data throughout the system.
   - **Technical Details**:
     - **Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares article text before it is sent to Watson, ensuring optimal input for analysis.
     - **Postprocessing**: Processes the analysis results from Watson, formatting them for storage and display.
     - **Validation**: Includes validation steps to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data being processed.

These services are critical to the project's ability to handle complex interactions with external APIs and AI services like IBM Watson.
